# Video-Game-Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
The global video game industry has become one of the most dynamic and profitable entertainment sectors. To remain competitive, it is essential to understand the factors influencing sales. This project aims to analyze historical data to uncover key trends, including the most successful genres, platforms, publishers, and regional preferences across North America, Europe, and Japan.

Additionally, the analysis will explore the relationship between a countryâ€™s GDP and video game sales, shedding light on how economic factors influence market performance. The findings will be presented using intuitive visualizations to ensure clarity and accessibility, enabling video game companies and stakeholders to leverage these insights for strategic decision-making and market expansion.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization
- Tools and frameworks (R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, Plotly)

## Key Finding
- Global Trends: Video game sales peaked in the late 2000s, followed by a decline due to market saturation and competition from mobile and online gaming.
- Popular Genres: Action games became the leading genre, surpassing sports games in releases and sales, especially on platforms like PS2, Xbox 360, and PS3.
- Regional Insights: North America led in sales, followed by Europe and Japan, with Japan showcasing stable performance despite economic fluctuations.
- Top Performers: Blockbuster games like Wii Sports and publishers such as Nintendo dominated the market, significantly influencing industry trends.
- Economic Correlation: GDP and sales trends aligned before 2008, but sales recovery lagged behind GDP post-crisis, except in Japan, where sales remained steady.
- Consumer Behavior: Higher IGN scores (above 7.5) generally correlated with greater sales, though exceeding this threshold did not guarantee higher performance. Steam reviews showed greater variability, even among top-selling games.

## Results
This analysis highlights the dynamic evolution of the video game industry, showing how market preferences, regional trends, and economic factors shape sales outcomes. Key findings emphasize the importance of tailoring strategies to regional preferences and leveraging top-performing genres and platforms for success. Stable markets, like Japan, demonstrate potential for sustained growth despite economic fluctuations.
